        <h4 class="project-title"><a href="http://www.blastmonkeys.com">Blast Monkeys</a></h4>
        <p>Blast Monkeys is a fun mash up of cannons, lunch time and timing. When your Monkey Cannon is lined up, tap on the green launch button to send your monkey flying to a nice lunch of goal bananas. If you mess up that's okay - your monkey forgives you and gets back into the cannon!</p>

        <h4 class="project-title"><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yobonja.blastmonkeysforever">Blast Monkeys</a></h4>
        <p>In Blast Monkeys Forever you will follow the story of how Moki got to space, blasting up through the clouds collecting bananas along the way.

The game play is a perfect marriage between the physics puzzle game that is Blast Monkeys and the 'infinite runner' mode of play.</p>
